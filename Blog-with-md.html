<p>To write this blog, I am using simplest possible blogging platform. I am using <a href="%22https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to create my blog. But, wait i am not even using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to blog using Github, VS Code and a markdown files. That's it. Nothing fancy, a minimalist blogging platform. Please check  <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to learn how to host your blog in GitHub. However, github recommends to use Jekyll. It may be a simple tool, but I couldn't get it installed properly on my window machine. The installation process was scary,  hundred's of ruby files, Gems etc, and god knows what all dependencies were getting downloaded on my machine. And if Jekyll does not work, go ahead and open a ticket with them, there was no simple work around.</p>
<p>May be, I could have fixed the issue, but I wanted to have lowest possible load of tools and tech for my blogging. I wanted to write my blogs in markdown, like readme files. However, md files are not liked by the browsers. They want HTML files. So, my first instinct was to use 'GitHub Actions' to convert the checked-in md files into html. But then the problem was to see the html output too late.</p>
<h2>Convert the markdown to html</h2>
<p>So, I thought, using one of the extensions I will convert the md file to html in VSCode. There are many &quot;Run on Save&quot; Extension for VS Code. But none work properly in my VSCode. Their documentation seems very straight forward, but unfortunately they don't work as advertised. So, lets go more simpler.</p>
<p>Best idea was to use Gulp and markdown-it. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_automating-markdown-compilation">See more here</a></p>
<p>Below few lines of code is only what you need. This code converts md files to html. Adds style sheet to the created html as a header and using gulp-footer formatted the file to a proper html file.</p>
<p>Here is my Gulp file:</p>
<pre><code>        var gulp = require('gulp');
        var markdown = require('gulp-markdown-it');
        var header = require('gulp-header');
        var footer = require('gulp-footer');

        gulp.task('markdown', function() {
            return gulp
            .src('*.md')
            .pipe(markdown())
            .pipe(header('&lt;html&gt; &lt;header&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;./style.css&quot;&gt; &lt;/header&gt;'))
            .pipe(footer('&lt;/html&gt;'))
            .pipe(
            gulp.dest(function(f) {
                return f.base;
            })
            .pipe(header('&lt;/html&gt; '))
            );
        });

        gulp.task('convert-md-to-html', function() {
            return gulp.watch('*.md', gulp.series(['markdown']));
        });
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>of course don't forget to npm install the packages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the Task.json file</p>
<pre><code>        {
        &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,
        &quot;tasks&quot;: [
            {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;gulp&quot;,
            &quot;task&quot;: &quot;convert-md-to-html&quot;,
            &quot;problemMatcher&quot;: [],
            &quot;group&quot;: {
                &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,
                &quot;isDefault&quot;: true
            }
            }
        ]
        }
</code></pre>
<p>What I like about this approach is there is no complicated tools are needed. Just write a md file, push it to GitHub and it get published.</p>
